# Polynomial Codes

All codes here are related to polynomial systems, deterministic and random. Solving polynomial systems is an old problem in Mathematics that still brings a lot of challenges. It is a remarkable field of study for it is connected to pratically all fields of Mathematics. Also, it has a lot of beautiful features, which makes it a special field, although one of the hardest ones.
